`neo-tree-unl.nvim` is a custom source for [neo-tree.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim) that displays the structure of an Unreal Engine project, parsed by [UEP.nvim](https://github.com/taku25/UEP.nvim), much like a solution explorer in an IDE.

It enables you to grasp your project not by its physical file hierarchy, but by its logical categories like "Game," "Plugins," and "Engine," as well as on a per-module basis.

This is a UI component of the **Unreal Neovim Plugin Sweet**, depending on [UNL.nvim](https://github.com/taku25/UNL.nvim) as a library and requiring the cache data generated by [UEP.nvim](https://github.com/taku25/UEP.nvim).

## ‚ú® Features

  * **IDE-like Logical View**:
      * Displays the project's logical structure (Game, Plugins, Engine, Module) instead of the raw filesystem.

  * **Driven by UEP.nvim Commands**:
      * All commands to display UEP's cache data are issued from UEP.
    * **Seamless View Switching**:
      * `:UEP tree`: Provides a bird's-eye view of the entire project structure.
      * `:UEP module_tree`: Switches to a focused mode on a single module.
    * **Loosely Coupled Architecture**:
      * Functions as a UI layer completely independent from `UEP.nvim`.
      * Communicates with `UEP.nvim` via the global event bus provided by `UNL.nvim`, ensuring they do not directly depend on each other.

## üîß Requirements

  * Neovim v0.8+
  * [**UNL.nvim**](https://github.com/taku25/UNL.nvim) (**Required**)
  * [**UEP.nvim**](https://github.com/taku25/UEP.nvim) (**Required, but not as a direct dependency**)
  * [**neo-tree.nvim**](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim) (**Required**)

## üöÄ Installation

Install with your favorite plugin manager. You will need to install `UEP.nvim` and `neo-tree.nvim` alongside it.
